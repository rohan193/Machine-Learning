## Linear regression

- [Assumptions](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-linear-regression/)
  - Linear relationship
  - Multivariate normality
  - No or little multicollinearity
  - No auto-correlation
  - Homoscedasticity

## Logistic regression

[Machine Learning - (Univariate|Simple) Logistic regression](https://gerardnico.com/data_mining/simple_logistic_regression)
- The idea of logistic regression is to make linear regression produce probabilities. It's always best to predict class probabilities instead of predicting classes
- The name “logistic” comes from the transformation of this model. This is a monotone transformation. And that transformation is called:
  - the log odds
  - or the logit transformation of the probability
- To summarize, we got still a linear model but it's modeling the probabilities on a non-linear scale

- Q. While measuring increment in sales due to marketing campaigns - 
  - How to conclude that the increment in sales was significant? Pre-post, test-control, YoY increase? 
  - How to remove the aspects of natural growth in sales, fact that some other marketing campaign might have been active during the same period last year? 
  - On what basis are the test control splits to be made - how to know that the splits are actually similar?
